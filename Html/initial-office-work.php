                <li>Open a Bank Account</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Registration of Your Place of Residence</h3>
            <p>
                Students must register their place of residence at the ward office within 14 days of entering Japan and deciding on their address. The ward office operates on weekdays, so plan your visit accordingly and ensure you bring your Residence Card. Completing this registration as soon as possible is crucial, as it is a prerequisite for opening a bank account. Additionally, inform your local ward office about any change of address within Japan.
            </p>

            <h3>Subscription to National Health Insurance</h3>
            <p>
                International students staying in Japan for more than three months must enroll in National Health Insurance. This insurance requires you to pay only 30% of your medical expenses, with the rest covered by monthly premiums. After registering your residence at the ward office, proceed to the National Health Insurance section for enrollment. The annual premium is around Â¥14,000, and you can opt for deferred payment. Your National Health Insurance card will be mailed to you by registered mail, and you must sign to receive it.
            </p>

            <h3>The Social Security and Tax Number System (My Number System)</h3>
            <p>
                In 2015, Japan introduced the Social Security and Tax Number System (My Number System). Every person with a Japanese resident record, including international students, receives a unique 12-digit number. This number is used for administrative tasks like Social Security and Taxation. The municipal office will send a notification card to your registered address. Once you receive it, store the card safely.
            </p>

            <h3>Open a Bank Account</h3>
            <p>
                Students must open a bank account to deposit money, send funds, pay utility bills by automatic transfer, obtain a credit card, and more. A bank account is also required to buy a mobile phone in Japan. You can receive and send money overseas by providing your 12-digit "My Number" and Residence Card to the bank. To open an account, you need your Student ID card, Residence Card (with registered address), and Passport. Some banks may require an inkan stamp or accept a signature. ATMs for Japan Post Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Bank, and Bank of Yokohama are available on campus.
